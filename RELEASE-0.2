# RELEASE-0.2
Project repository: https://github.com/RazeSoldier/PhpWget

This is the second release of PhpWget Project.

In this release, PhpWget add a new feature -- extract tar/zip archive.
Now, you can extract tar/zip archive after download, only add the long option '--UZ' at the end of the command.
Archive will be extracted in a new folder, the original archive will not be deleted.
Note that due to an interpreter bug, in PHP 5.5.24-, PhpWget can't extract BSD generated tar file, only support ustar format.
