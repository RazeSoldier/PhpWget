# RELEASE-0.3
Project repository: https://github.com/RazeSoldier/PhpWget

This is the third develop release of PhpWget Project.

We add a new feature - verify the integrity of file. But currently
only supports MD5, SHA1 and SHA256. We will add more kinds of verification ways
in the future.

Starting from version 0.3, PhpWget will support large file download.

Starting from this release, we provide a succinct way to run PhpWget. We provide
a phar build script - build.php, this script can build the phar archive of PhpWget.
The phar archive generated by the build script can be used like ordinary PHP files.

In this release, we also fix a Windows file system bug.
